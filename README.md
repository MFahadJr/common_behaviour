# common_behaviour

The data provided is collected from various sensors of the different types installed at different rooms of a smart house. The project consist of determining when the households are at home or not. Supervised learning (Na√Øve Bayesian Network, Decision Tree) is used to determine the model that could predict people being in-home. Considering real-time data and the noise in it, multiple people living in the house, the model's accuracy is exceptional. The most common behaviour is observed during the recorded period on the sofa and in the bed. Since the data is a time series, the matrix profile has been calculated to determine the motif for this problem.
